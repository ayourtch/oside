ScaRust (pronounced "scar[i]est") is a packet parsing/creation framework heavily inspired by the venerable Scapy.

The focus, much like the Scapy's, is a very flexible packet manipulation
without too much of the paperwork. As a result, it is entirely possible to create
completely invalid or non-conforming packets. Also, "because I can",
as an exercise and an illustration, the library contains as well a pcap file format reader/writer.

The framework is currently in "feasibility study/proof of concept" stage, which means that everything
can absolutely entirely change without any notice, so you have been warned. 
For this precise reason the code is the documentation at this point in time.
